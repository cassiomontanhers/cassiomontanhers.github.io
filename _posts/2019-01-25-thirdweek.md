# Third Week

Hello there, here it is another post about the project progress. This week I wanted to solve my database connection issue, and doing so I had to change the project a little bit.

- Firstly I've implemented some code to use sqlite as my database instead of using SqlAlchemy, and with that I solved my connection problem (Yay!). I've got a little confused about the concept of the SqlAlchemy Session, so to not delay the project I've decided to use sqlite, which I've managed to create a raw login and session validation.

- I tryied to create some templates with Jinja2, I had some issues with the concept of using the blocks of the parent and the child files, but by the end of the week I've managed to create a basic main menu and now I'm ready to develop some more complex templates.

So for the next week, as I was able to register new users and validate their session and login, I want to develop the user dream register so I can have a MVP and start to work on improvements.

Here are a couple of screenshots of the current state of the project!
