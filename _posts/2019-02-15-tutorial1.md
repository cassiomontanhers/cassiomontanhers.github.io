# React Tutorial Project

Hello there, I`am Cassio Montanher and I will start a new project, a React Tutorial, and I will record my weekly progress in this blog.

I decided to do this project to learn the React library, as during my job hunting in Vancouver I discovered that React (and Redux) is quite popular and being requested by a lot of tech companies. Even in my previous work experirence the company started to encourage its employees to learn React is it would be a standard technology at the company.

So to reach new job opportunities I'm gonna create a tutorial for a Web Application using NodeJS as the server-side language, and React as the front-end, and a AWS MySQL server as the database to test my new skills and provide a guide for people that want to start with React.

This project are gonna help me to show my improvement and current knowledge about the library and its uses.
