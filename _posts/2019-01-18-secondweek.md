# Second Week

Hello there, in this post I'm going to discuss a little bit about my progress towards the project this week.

- Firstly I've study the base syntax and functinality of the python language, and that gave me the firt glance at all the power and possibilities of the language. One thing that called my atention was the fact that block identation is a main factor of the language, something that I've never encountered before.

- After getting the python basics, I've started to use the Flask framework to make my first Web App using python. The framework make it fairly simple to route and run a web based application, nothing too fancy, a few lines of code and you are all set! Their own web site have all the basics on how to get it started. (check out their guides [here](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/#routing)).

I decided to do this project to learn the Python langague, as during my job hunting in Vancouver I discovered that Python is a quite popular language and being requested by a lot of tech companies. 

So to reach new job opportunities I'm gonna develop a Web Application using Python as the server-side language, Flask or Django Web Frameworks and MySQL as the database to test my new skills and start to build a portifolio of applications. The project are going to be a log of dreams, that will gather the most common topics of the recorded dreams to try to find a pattern on the given day, or to show a pattern throughout a period of time. 

This project are gonna help me to show my improvement and current knowledge about the language and its uses.
