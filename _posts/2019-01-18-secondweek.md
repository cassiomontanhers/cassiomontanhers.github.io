# Second Week

Hello there, in this post I'm going to discuss a little bit about my progress towards the project this week.

- Firstly I've study the base syntax and functinality of the python language, and that gave me the firt glance at all the power and possibilities of the language. One thing that called my atention was the fact that block identation is a main factor of the language, something that I've never encountered before.

- After getting the python basics, I've started to use the Flask framework to make my first Web App using python. The framework make it fairly simple to route and run a web based application, nothing too fancy, a few lines of code and you are all set! Their own web site have all the basics on how to get it started. (check out their guides [here](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/#routing)).

- While I was checking out what the Flask Framework could do, I've encountered the Jinja2 template engine that generates automatic HTML based on your python code, helping you alot to fill your pages with flexible information (it reminds me alot AngularJS ).

- At last, after trying a bit with the routing and the Jinja template, I've tryied to implement connection to a database to create a login feature using SQLite and the SqlAlchemy library, but this is still a work in progress as I've faced some issues making it work (When I try to insert a new record, it doens't find any table).

So for the next week, I want to solve this database connection issue, and have a page to insert user dreams records and a sign in form.

Here are a couple of screenshots of the current state of the project!
