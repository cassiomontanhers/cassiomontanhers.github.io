# Python Project

Hello there, I`am Cassio Montanher and this blog will be the record my weekly progress of my Python project.

I decided to do this project to learn the Python langague, as during my job hunting in Vancouver I discovered that Python is a quite popular language and being requested by a lot of tech companies. 

So to reach new job opportunities I'm gonna develop a Web Application using Python as the server-side language, Flask or Django Web Frameworks and MySQL as the database to test my new skills and start to build a portifolio of applications. The project are going to be a log of dreams, that will gather the most common topics of the recorded dreams to try to find a pattern on the given day, or to show a pattern throughout a period of time. 

This project are gonna help me to show my improvement and current knowledge about the language and its uses.
