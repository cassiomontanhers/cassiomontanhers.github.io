# Fourth Week

Hello there, here it is one of the last post about the project progress. This week I finish the primary features of the project.

- I finilized the user signin and login features.

- The main screen now displays a random logged dream from any user.

- Created the log dream feature.

So for the next week, I want to improve some features to have a more user friendly application.
Here are a couple of screenshots of the current state of the project!
