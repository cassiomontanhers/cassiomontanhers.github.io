# Final Evaluation

I believe I achieved partially my goals. I faced a lot of problems trying to figure out how to solve simple issues with React, and the amount of ways to do it made it really confusing, and specially the time that I devoted for the project wasn't enough to learn it the way I wanted. But for a first project I think I got the basic concepts of it, and faced some beginner issues that I'm gonna be familiar with for a next React project, as I want to learn other technologies that work with React, like redux (which was the one that I encoutered the most during my research).

I had to change the scope of the project a couple of times, as I wasn't being able to figure it all out and reduced it to make a simple React application, which were still challenging for me, and it made me go to some tutorials to figure out my tutorial, which helped me to solve some of my issues but not the ones I was having, so I had to toss everything away and begin again from a blank state. Which I've learn different things, but not to a point I was satisfied with.

React is a awesome technology with alot of uses and have a broad community, but has some concepts that might be challenging for newcommers, so if I could give and advice about this technology is invest some time into learning it, start with small concepts, learn the life cycle, take small steps, otherwise you will be overwhelmed with information that will not be usefull for you at the moment and will only make things harder for you.

For my next step, firstly I want to take some steps back, and review some concepts, and then try to create an full application, and when I'm confortable with it, move to a new challenge with Redux.
