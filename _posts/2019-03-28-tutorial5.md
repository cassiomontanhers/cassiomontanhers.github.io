# React Tutorial
Hello, in this tutorial we are going to go through a simple React app that uses React Router to make a Single Page Application (SPA). You can check out the example project in my github https://github.com/cassiomontanhers/reactProject/tree/develop.

First things first, you will need to install npm & nodejs in your computer, you can go to this link to download it. https://nodejs.org/en/

So, with npm installed, lets setup our project:

1 - Set Up
- Open your desired console.
- Run: “npm install -g create-react-app”. This will allow us to run a couple of commands to start up our project.
- Then run: “create-react-app react_spa” in a desired folder you want to place the project
- Go inside the new created folder “react_spa”.
- Run: “npm i react-router-dom –save” this command will install a couple of files that will allow us to create a SPA using the React Router, which is one of the ways to build a SPA using the routing capabilities of React.

2 - Delete all the files from “public” and “src” folder as we are not going to use them.

3 - Create index.html file inside public folder. This file will be our default page, which is going to be used as a start point of our project:

**index.html**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport"
          content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
    <title>React Router Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

4 - Create index.js file inside src folder. So this is our first encounter with React. In this file we are telling our app to import a couple of files (some of them we got from the 1 step of our tutorial), one of them being the “Main” file that we will create at the next step. But for now the important part of this file, is that we are calling “ReactDOM.render” which is telling the app to place a <Main> element (that we are going to create at the next step too) inside the element with an id equal to “root”.

**index.js**
```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import Main from "./Main";
 
ReactDOM.render(
  <Main/>, 
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

5 - Create main.js file inside “src” folder. Okay, now we are creating the so called “Main” element. In this file we are declaring a new react component called “Main”, and where this element is stated, it will display or better saying “render” some html code that we wrote. 

**Main.js**
```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
 
class Main extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
        <div>
          <h1>My Dogs</h1>
          <ul className="header">
            <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="/nina">Nina</a></li>
            <li><a href="/meg">Meg</a></li>
          </ul>
          <div className="content">
             
          </div>
        </div>
    );
  }
}
 
export default Main;
```

6 – If you want to try out how the project is looking, you can type “npm start” at the console to run the project.


7 - Create Home.js file inside src folder. Now, as we are creating a SPA, we will need a couple of pages to try it out, so let’s create a new component “Home” that will behave just like the “Main” element, but it will be used as the content of one of our pages. I know a little confusing but be calm, let’s first create our pages and you will understand the concept in a couple of steps.

**Home.js**
```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
 
class Home extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Woof Woff</h2>
        <p>Hello, I would like to introduce you to my friends. Meg and Nina.</p>
      </div>    );
  }
}
 
export default Home;
```

8 - Create Nina.js file inside src folder. Okay, so now we are creating the Nina component, and as I said, this will be a component just like the others, but it will be used to mock a page with content, and this page will be about one of my dogs, Nina.

**Nina.js**
```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
 
class Nina extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
     <div>
        <h2>Nina</h2>
        <p>Nina is a Samoyed. She's big and fluffy and likes to play alot and have long walks.</p>
      </div>    
     );
  }
}
 
export default Nina;
```

9 - Create Meg.js file inside src folder. Just like the Nina component, we are creating the Meg component, that will behave as a page for my other dog, Meg (Yeah, I love dogs).

**Meg.js**
```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
 
class Meg extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Meg</h2>
        <p>Meg is a Maltese. She's a little grumpy, and doesn't like to take pictures, but is the cutest thing in the world.</p>
      </div>    );
  }
}
 
export default Meg;
```

10 - Add this import list into Main.js. So lets import all these new components and files into our main element.

```javascript
import {
  Route,
  NavLink,
  HashRouter
} from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./Home";
import Nina from "./Nina";
import Meg from "./Meg";
```

11 - Add the following tag's to wrap the component return of Main.js. So this is the complicated part where we will make the routing of our app. A simple way to explain this, is that React Router need to have a workspace defined to link the url path you have and the content you want to be loaded. The “HashRouter” element helps this process into handling the routing. So inside the Main element render function, wrap the html code with these tags.

```html
<HashRouter>
...
</HashRouter>
```

12 - Change the “a” links at Main.js main component with this tags. So just like did in the previous step, React need a more specialized way to handle its routing, so replace the common “a” element with the NavLink element.

```html
<li><NavLink exact to="/">Home</NavLink></li>
<li><NavLink to="/stuff">Stuff</NavLink></li>
<li><NavLink to="/contact">Contact</NavLink></li>
```

13 - Add the following tags inside the div “content” of the main compoment at Main.js. In this part we are telling our app to load the specified content that we are importing(our components), when our url path is equal to the desired value, so we certify that we are displaying the correct component when it is requested. So basically our components are acting like an individual web page but with a different behavior, allowing us to use them in a SPA.

```html
<Route exact path="/" component={Home}/>
<Route path="/nina" component={Nina}/>
<Route path="/meg" component={Meg}/>
```

14 - Create index.css file inside the src folder. So to add a little bit of flavor and visual effects add this css to our project.

**index.css**
```css
html {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

h1{
  color: #8D3527;
  text-align: center;
}

p, h2{
  color: #3D271C;
}

body {
  background-color: #FCCA73;
  padding: 20px;
  margin: 0;
}

.header li {
  display: inline;
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0;
}

.header {
  background-color: #8D3527;
  padding: 0;
}

.header a {
  color: #FCCA73;
  font-weight: bold;
  text-decoration: none;
  padding: 1.5rem;
  display: inline-block;
}

.content {
  background-color: #CE7C2A;
  padding: 1rem;
}

.active {
  background-color: #3D271C;
}

img{
  max-width: 300px;
  max-height: 300px;
  margin: 1rem;
}```

15 - Add the import of the css file at index.js. Don’t forget to import this new file, otherwise it will be worthless.
```javascript
import "./index.css";
```

16 – You can check out the example project at https://github.com/cassiomontanhers/reactProject/tree/develop to check out some img files to import to this tutorial, or clone it to see how it should look like at this point.


17 - run “npm start” to run the project.
